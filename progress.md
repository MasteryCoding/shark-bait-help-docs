# Progress

The progress view is a more streamlined way to access the last section you left off on. When this view is opened, it will show the latest chapter a student opened so they can hop right in where they left off.

The sections with an orange icon are sections that have been opened by a student. The sections with a white icon have not yet been accessed. As a teacher, the latest unlocked chapter of a Unit will determine which Unit will display on this view.
