# Classroom Settings

The classroom settings page allows you to create, modify, export, and reset passwords for your students in your classroom. You can also edit your classroom name and delete your classroom on this page.

## Student Management

### Creating Students

There are two ways to create students. The first is using the "+ Add Student" button at the bottom of the table. This is a good way to add students one by one.

To create a student, enter their first and last name. Then enter their student ID number. This does not have to be their real student ID, but it helps if it is a number the student is already familiar with since it will be part of their username.

Once the form is submitted, a username will be generated using the student's initials and the ID number provided in the form. This can be changed later using the edit button on a student's row.

### Bulk Student Upload

If you have more than one class, it can be cumbersome entering all of the student information. You can upload your class roster as a CSV to populate a class instantly.

If you download the CSV template, there are three columns on the form that you can paste values in from your class roster using spreadsheet software of your choice (e.g. MS Excel, Google Sheets). You can enter your student data like so.

| First Name | Last Name | Student ID |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| June   | Gold | 000001
| May    | Winters | 000002
| April  | Cooper | 000003

When CSV is ready, use the "Upload CSV" button on the "Classroom Settings" page to select your file and populate your classroom.
